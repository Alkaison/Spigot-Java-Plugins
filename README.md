# Spigot Java Plugins

#### Minecraft Server Plugins made on various different concepts & basis. All the plugins listed here are made by me -> **Alkaison**

## 01. JoinLeaveMessages - [Download](https://github.com/Alkaison/Spigot-Java-Plugins/blob/main/Downloads/JoinLeaveMessage-0.1.2.jar "JoinLeaveMessage")

 Sends custom message on player join & leave. Sends a unique message when a player joins the server for the first time.
 
**Note:** *There is a default message that I've placed inside the plugin because message customisation is not yet available in this version.*

## 02. LineCommands - [Download](https://github.com/Alkaison/Spigot-Java-Plugins/blob/main/Downloads/LineCommands-0.1.5.jar "LineCommands")

This plugin introduces the basics of the player commands, different functions & types of sender.

**Commands with Alias:**

- /god (Alias: bhagwan) **-** makes the player invincible.
- /heal (Alias: recover) **-** fulls the player's heart.
- /feed (Alias: food) **-** fulls the player's hunger bar.

**Note**: *All three of these commands can be used by players without their permission.*
